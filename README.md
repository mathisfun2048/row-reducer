## What is this??
A lot of linear algebra operations that are difficult (or impossible!) to enter into a calculator. This application aims to simplify this through providing 22 different matrix and vector functions accessible through a virtual CLI. The purpous is to help students check their work through a simplistic website.

## What functions are avalible?
Glad you asked. So far, we have the following functions: 

### Scaler / Single Value Functions 
det(A)
trace(A)
rank(A)
null(A)
magnitude(v)
dot_product(v1, v2)
lin_ind(A)

### Matrix / Vector Functions
rref(A)
inverse(A)
transpose(A)
cross(v1, v2)
projection(a, v)
matrix_mult(A, B)
solve_system(A, b)
eigenvectors(A)

### Basis Functions
null_space(A)
col_space(A)
row_space(A)
change_of_basis(old, new)

### Decomposition Functions
lu(A)
qr(A)
diagonalize(A)
