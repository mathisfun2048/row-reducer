## Hour 2 

I thought about adding some more linear algebra methods. 

In the last hour, I have implemented LU and QR factorization. I am going to do diagnolization next!

## Hour 3

Wrote all the methods for diagonalization, now time to test and write printer functions!

## Hour 4-5

Finished implementing 10 functions, and am working on more

## Hour 6

Implemented some more functions:

## Hour 7

Was able to finally implement eigenvalues and eigenvectors! Next step is to implement that into diagonalization, and then repeated matrix exponentiation!
